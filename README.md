# Isolation Forests

This is my implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm from 
[this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224384174_Isolation_Forest) by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, 
and Zhi-Hua Zhou. This code adapted from a project I did for a course in Algorithms and Data Structures taught by [Terence Parr](https://github.com/parrt) as part of the University of San Francisco Master of Science in Data Science program.

## Data

I used a breast cancer dataset in Scikit-learn and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle.
