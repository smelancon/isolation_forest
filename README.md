# Isolation Forests

This is my implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm from 
[this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224384174_Isolation_Forest) by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, 
and Zhi-Hua Zhou. This was a project for a course in Algorithms and Data Structures taught by Terence Parr as part of
the University of San Francisco Master of Science in Data Science program.
